# Styled and Responsive Web Page Boilerplate

Have you ever needed to create a decent looking simple website for your personal project, but did you spend more time on its design than on working on its functionality?
This is normally not a problem but I found it tedious. This extension will solve the issue for you with a simple `!T + @<page name>` and you're up and running with a fully styled and responsive web page template. Connect web pages together and voila you have a ready website.
